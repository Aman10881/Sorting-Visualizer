# Sorting Visualizer

A web-based tool that visualizes various sorting algorithms such as **Bubble Sort**, **Merge Sort**, **Quick Sort**, and **Insertion Sort**. This project helps users understand how these algorithms work by providing real-time animations of their execution.

## Features
- **Bubble Sort**: Visualize how the bubble sort algorithm compares and swaps adjacent elements.
- **Merge Sort**: See the divide-and-conquer process of merge sort as it recursively splits the array and merges sorted sub-arrays.
- **Quick Sort**: Understand the partitioning process and recursive sorting of the quicksort algorithm.
- **Insertion Sort**: Watch the step-by-step process of insertion sort placing elements in their correct position.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling of the sorting bars and page layout.
- **JavaScript**: Implementation of the sorting algorithms and visualization logic.
